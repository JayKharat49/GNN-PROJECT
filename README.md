# GNN-PROJECT
# GNN Project on HIV Virus

This repository hosts a Graph Neural Network (GNN) project dedicated to studying the HIV virus. The project encompasses various components and functionalities designed to analyze the virus, generate molecules using generative GNN models, provide a user interface, and employ explainable AI techniques on graphs.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following major components:

1. **Custom Dataset Building**: We've constructed a custom dataset using PyTorch Geometric tailored specifically to HIV virus-related data. This dataset serves as the foundation for our GNN models.

2. **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: We've implemented a GNN architecture to analyze and extract valuable insights from the HIV virus data. The GNN leverages the graph structure of the data to make predictions and identify patterns.

3. **Generative GNN Models**: In addition to analysis, we've developed generative GNN models. These models are capable of generating molecules, contributing to drug discovery and design efforts related to HIV.

4. **Deployment and UI with Streamlit**: To make the project accessible and user-friendly, we've deployed it with Streamlit. This provides a web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the GNN models and visualize results.

5. **Explainable AI on Graphs**: We've implemented explainable AI techniques tailored to graph data. This helps interpret and understand the GNN's predictions and insights, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of HIV-related phenomena.
